#    "--prioritize": null # Default is FALSE. Pass flag to prioritize features by the order they appear in the feat_annotation asset when calculating FRiF/PRiF
#    "--sob": null        # Default is FALSE. Pass flag to use seqOutBias for signal track generation and to incorporate mappability
#    "--scale": null      # Default is FALSE. Pass flag to scale seqOutBias signal tracks
#    "--coverage": null   # Default is FALSE. Pass flag to use coverage when producing library complexity plots.
#    "--keep": null       # Default is FALSE. Pass flag to keep prealignment BAM files.
#    "--noFIFO": null     # Default is FALSE. Pass flag to NOT use named pipes during prealignments.
#    "--complexity": null # Default is TRUE.  Pass flag to disable library complexity calculation. Faster.
